# Black-Red Tree of Intervals

This OCaml application consists of three modules :
- A functor which represents a Black-Red Tree
- A functor which represents the mathematical concept of intervals
- A module which combine the previous functors to create a functor of Black-Red Tree of intervals <br/><br/>

The final functor can get any type of intervals, as long as the type is valid.<br/>

## Installation

You need to install ocaml on your computer. <br/>
You can then compile the project with ocaml.


## Usages

Launching the project will perform a serie of test on the different module with random elements to test the validity of the structures
